Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R:  person("Daniel", "Hammarstr√∂m", email = "daniel.hammarstrom@inn.no", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package contains implementations of methods for reference gene selection in qPCR-experiments. Implemented methods are geNorm (Vandesompele et al. 2002), Normfinder (Andersen et al. 2004) and selection of stable genes in a mixed model framework (Dai et al. 2013). All methods are implemented in functions to be used with data formatted in a tidy manner (each row an observation and each column a variable).
